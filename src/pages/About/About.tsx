					Our Story
				</h1>
				<p>Salaam, I‚Äôm Fahan, the founder of Nisa Invest. üê™üíú</p>
				<p>
					I began my career in finance eight years ago, in 2016, and with it
					came a flood of questions and decisions: How do I read my payslip?
					What taxes am I paying? How do I learn about my pension? How much
					should I be saving? What about student loans, halal investing, and
					Zakat?
				</p>
				<blockquote className='pl-4 border-l-8'>
					<p>
						Alhamdulillah, working in banking and studying behavioural economics
						at university helped a lot. I also had access to financial wellness
						benefits through my workplace, which fuelled my determination to get
						started.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					My passion led me to start a small blog, Fahan Finance, where I shared
					my discoveries. And when my friend Sumaya started a sister‚Äôs circle at
					our mosque, I was invited to run a session on personal finance.

						In February 2023, I ran a session on personal finance at my mosque‚Äôs
						sisters circle
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					During this session, I shared my biggest lesson, which was that over
					the years:
				</p>
				<blockquote className='pl-4 border-l-8'>
					<p>
						I wasn‚Äôt only investing according to my Islamic principles. I was
						also striving to earn, spend, save, and give my money in line with
						my values as a Muslim.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					In the months that followed, I asked myself: What would it look like
					if I became a financial planner, started a company, and called it Nisa
					Invest so I could reach sisters everywhere?
				</p>
				<p>
					JazakAllah khair for being here. I am excited to learn about your
					goals for yourself, your legacy, and your loved ones. May Allah SWT
					make it easy, Ameen.
